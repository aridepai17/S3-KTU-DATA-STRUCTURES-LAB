Step-by-Step Algorithm for Linear Search

1. Start

2. Input Array Size
   - Prompt the user to enter the number of elements (`size`) in the array.
   - Store this value in a variable called `size`.

3. Declare the Array
   - Declare an array `arr` of size `size`.

4. Input Array Elements
   - Prompt the user to enter the elements of the array.
   - For each element (from index `0` to `size-1`):
     - Read the element and store it in `arr[i]`.

5. Input Target Element
   - Prompt the user to enter the target element (`target`) that they want to search for in the array.
   - Store this value in a variable called `target`.

6. Initialize Search
   - Set a variable `found_index` to `-1` to track if the target is found.

7. Perform Linear Search
   - Loop through each element in the array from index `0` to `size-1`:
     - Compare `arr[i]` with the `target`.
     - If `arr[i]` equals `target`:
       - Set `found_index` to `i` (the current index).
       - Break the loop since the target is found.

8. Check Result
   - If `found_index` is not `-1`:
     - Print that the element was found and its index.
   - Otherwise:
     - Print that the element was not found in the array.

9. End
